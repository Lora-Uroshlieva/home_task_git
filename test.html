        <p>By end the end of this course, you'll have gained familiarity with a very convenient, flexible server-side language: PHP. You'll be exposed to many fundamental programming concepts such as data types, functions, control flow, and more. </p>
        <h3 id="why-learn-php-">Why learn PHP?</h3>
        <p>PHP is one of the simplest server-side languages out there, and it was designed primarily for web development. Learning PHP is good not only because it adds one more language to your toolbelt, but also because there is a large number of sites currently built with Wordpress, a content management system (CMS) built with PHP. </p>
